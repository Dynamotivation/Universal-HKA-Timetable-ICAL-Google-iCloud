# Universal-HKA-Timetable-ICAL-Google-iCloud

This is a Google Apps Script project ment to make your HKA timetable universally accessible. This is done by scraping the webpage to your Google Calendar. From Google Calendar you can easily access your timetable by using the Google Calendar app, adding it to your iCloud Calendar or by using the iCal file generated by Google Calendar in any other app. The script will run on Googles Servers serverlessly for free.

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here.](https://script.google.com/d/1Jm2jbxNJcgGHLhHBAMxRtGH5V9SdGD84nzg_k_UteYVs_nVqlGSkmJ3n/edit?newcopy=true)

**To make a copy in the new Google Apps Script interface:**
1. Go to the project overview icon on the left (looks like this: â“˜)
2. Click the "copy" icon on the top right (looks like two files on top of each other)

This script is inspired by Derek Antrican's GAS-ICS-Sync

**NOTE:** If too many people are accessing the file at the same time, Google may lock you out. You can follow these instructions to set up the script: https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/wiki/Setting-up-the-script-manually
